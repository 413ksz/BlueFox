Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! At this time, I'm focusing on developing it myself and not actively accepting external contributions.
This is a personal project I'm using to learn and experiment, so I'm keeping the scope focused for now.
I may consider accepting contributions like bug reports or feature requests in the future. If that changes, I'll be sure to update this file!
