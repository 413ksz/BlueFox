## ü§ù Contributing (How You Can Help - Maybe Later!)

Right now, this project is being built by Debreczeni Alex J√°nos.
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! At this time, I'm focusing on developing it myself and not actively accepting external contributions. This is a personal project I'm using to learn and experiment, so I'm keeping the scope focused for now. I may consider accepting contributions like bug reports or feature requests in the future. If that changes, I'll be sure to update this file!

## ‚ú® Tech Stack

This chat app is will powered by some really neat tools:

* **Frontend:** [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) - A super fast and reactive JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Think of it like a really efficient engine for making your website interactive!
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework that lets you style your app quickly by using pre-made classes. It's like having a big box of ready-to-use design Lego bricks!
* **Backend:** [Go](https://go.dev/) - A powerful and efficient programming language perfect for handling all the behind-the-scenes stuff, like managing messages and users. It's like the strong foundation of your app!
* **Database:** [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - A modern and type-safe way to interact with your database. It helps your Go backend talk to and store information smoothly. Think of it as the librarian that organizes all your chat data!

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Developers!)

Want to see this in action or even help build it? Here's how you can get started on your own computer:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed on your system:

* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (for the backend)
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (for the frontend - it comes with its own package manager!)

### Running the Application

Follow these steps to get the chat app up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/413ksz/BlueFox.git
    cd BlueFox
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    go mod tidy  # Download any necessary Go packages
    # You might need to set up your database connection here. Check for a config file!
    go run main.go
    ```
    *(This will start your Go backend server. Keep this running in a separate terminal window!)*

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    bun install       # Install all the frontend dependencies (like Solid.js and Tailwind) using Bun!
    bun run dev       # Start the frontend development server using Bun!
    ```
    *(This will usually open your chat app in your web browser, often at `http://localhost:3000` or something similar!)*

If you think this project is cool, feel free to give it a star ‚≠ê on GitHub! It helps others discover it too!
